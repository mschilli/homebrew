Mike's Homebrew Tap
===================

This is a collection of command line utilities I've written over the years and keep
using on a regular basis. Hopefully, you'll find them useful.

* autorot - Physically rotate a photo that has the rotation exif tag set
* ethtop - Top-(Unix)-like utility to continuously display obtained DHCP addresses
* inuke - Weed out photos quickly
* wifi - Quick connection checker
* ynabler - YNAB bank/credit card account CSV converter

To install utilities from this tap, run

```
brew tap mschilli/homebrew https://github.com/mschilli/homebrew
```

* To install a package (e.g. ynabler), run

```
    brew update
    brew install ynabler
```

Enjoy!

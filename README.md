Mike's Homebrew Tap
===================

This is a collection of command line utilities I've written over the years, some
published in Linux Magazine, and keep using on a regular basis.
Hopefully, you'll find them useful as well.

* autorot - Physically rotate a photo that has the rotation exif tag set ([Linux-Magazine 2022-04](https://www.linux-magazine.com/Issues/2022/257/SunnySide-Up))
* ethtop - Top-(Unix)-like utility to continuously display obtained DHCP addresses ([Linux-Magazine 2019-01](https://www.linux-magazine.com/Issues/2019/218/Classics-Repackaged)
* inuke - Weed out photos quickly ([Linux Magazine 2022-01](https://www.linux-magazine.com/Issues/2022/254/Wheat-and-Chaff))
* wifi - Quick connection checker ([Linux Magazine 2023-10](https://www.linux-magazine.com/Issues/2023/275/Programming-Snapshot-Go-Network-Diagnostics))
* ynabler - YNAB bank/credit card account CSV converter
* renamer - Rename files in bulk ([Linux-Magazine 2021-03](https://www.linux-magazine.com/Issues/2021/244/Programming-Snapshot-Bulk-Renaming))
